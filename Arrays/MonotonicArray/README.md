## 📌 Array Problems

### Monotonic Array (LeetCode 896)

**Problem:**  
An array is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

**Approach:**  
- Assume array is both increasing and decreasing.
- Traverse once and invalidate conditions.
- If either condition holds, return true.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
